        <h5>Born and raised in the 'Show-Me' state, I moved to Memphis shortly after graduating from college for what I thought would be a 10-week summer job repairing homes in Binghampton. Ten years later I'm still here and love being a Memphian. In that time I've met and married my wife, adopted two pups, bought a home, made lifelong friends, and watched as this city has changed before my eyes. I've had the honor of working with a few of Memphis' most reputable organizations and take pride in being an active member in shaping my community.</h5>
